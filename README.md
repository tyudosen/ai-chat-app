## About

This project is a basic implementation of an AI chat interface. It allows users to input text and receive responses generated by an AI model. The application is built with the Next.js framework for a performant and scalable frontend, React for the user interface, and leverages the Vercel AI SDK to handle the interaction with an AI model.

This app serves as a starting point for exploring the capabilities of the Vercel AI SDK and building conversational AI experiences.

## Features

*   Simple chat interface.
*   Send messages to an AI model.
*   Display AI responses.

## Demo (Optional)

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

*   Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
*   npm or yarn or pnpm
*   An OpenAI API key.

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

2.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    pnpm install
    ```

### Running Locally

1.  Create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project.
2.  Add your AI model API key to the `.env.local` file. The exact variable name will depend on which AI model provider you are using with the Vercel AI SDK. Common examples:

    ```dotenv
    # For OpenAI
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
    ```

    (Replace `your_openai_api_key`, `your_anthropic_api_key`, etc., with your actual API key. Refer to the Vercel AI SDK documentation for the correct environment variable name for your provider.)

3.  Run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```

4.  Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Configuration

*   **API Key:** Configure your AI model API key in the `.env.local` file as described in the [Running Locally](#running-locally) section.
*   **AI Model:** The project is configured to use a specific AI model. You can change the model used in the API route (`app/api/chat/route.ts` or similar) if needed. Refer to the Vercel AI SDK documentation for supported models and how to configure them.

    ```typescript
    // Example in your API route (app/api/chat/route.ts)
    const openai = new OpenAI({
      apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
    });

    export async function POST(req: Request) {
      // ... rest of your code
      const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
        model: 'gpt-3.5-turbo', // <-- Change the model name here
        stream: true,
        messages,
      });
      // ...
    }
    ```

## Built With

*   [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
*   [React](https://reactjs.org/)
*   [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/)
*   (Add any other significant libraries or frameworks you used, e.g., Tailwind CSS, Chakra UI, etc.)
